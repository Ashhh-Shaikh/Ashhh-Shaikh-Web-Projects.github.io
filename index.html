                ☛ 2006: Taylor Swift releases her first single and album
		By age 16, Taylor was already getting major recognition 
		as an established country artist. She released her first 
		single, 'Tim McGraw', off her self-titled debut album, 
		which was later certified platinum by the 
		Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).


		Her album was released on October 24th 2006 by Big Machine 
		Records. The songstress wrote the best-performing songs 
		'Teardrops On My Guitar', 'Should've Said No' and 
		'Picture To Burn' whilst juggling high school with her 
		blossoming music career.


		Impressively, the singer-songwriter became the youngest 
		person in history to single-handedly write and perform a 
		Number 1 song on the Hot Country Songs chart with 'Our Song'. 
		'Teardrops on My Guitar' also performed well commercially, 
		spending 48 weeks in the Billboard chart and became Taylor's 
		first US top 20 hit.<br><br>

		☛ 2008: Taylor Swift's 'Fearless' album
		The super-talented Taylor released her second album, 'Fearless',

		consecutive weeks in the US.

		Billboard chart for 36 weeks. With the iconic music video re-telling 
		a fairytale love, it became a firm fan favourite and cemented 
		Taylor Swift in the pop scene. 'Love Story' won a number of awards 
		including Song of The Year at BMI's Country Awards.<br><br>

		☛ 2009: VMA Best Female Video award
		Although this might not typically be a highlight, it did 
		start the complicated relationship that Taylor Swift and Kanye West
		went on to have. If you don't know what we're talking about then 
		here's a quick recap. During her acceptance speech for her 
		Best Female Video award win, Kanye West interrupted her on stage 
		to speak up for Beyoncé's 'Single Ladies' video, which he believed 
		should have won the award. This event started an infamous feud between 
		the pair that spanned a decade.


		Thankfully, Taylor later had the chance to finish her VMA's winner's 
		speech when Beyoncé invited her back on stage during her own win.


		Taylor Swift's 2009 was not clouded by this though as this was also 
		the year that she embarked on her debut concert tour 'Fearless'. 
		The tour was named after her second album of the same name. 
		Beginning in Indiana and concluding in Canada, Justin Bieber was 
		one of the support acts for this tour back in 2009.

		☛ 2010: Taylor makes film debut in Valentine's Day
		Taylor Swift proved she is a woman of many talents in her debut 
		film role in the 2010 Valentine's Day. She played Felicia Miller 
		the film, with the plot following a group of characters through their 
		love struggles and relationships on Valentine's Day.


		She was also listed as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People
